      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Yu M. et al. (2016), phenotype is translated from genotype based on gene ontology, and predicted interaction scores
may be influenced by errors in gene annotations or relationship between terms. As deep learning being effective in
identifying complex patterns from feature-rich datasets, especially as recurrent neural networks(RNNs) such as long
short term memory(LSTM) and gated recurrent unit(GRU) are capable of dealing with long-distance sequential data,
predicting genetic interactions directly from DNA or amino-acid sequences using deep learning techniques would help us
gain insights into underlying complex phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
