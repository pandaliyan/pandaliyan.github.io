abstract: "Verb prediction is important for understanding human processing of verb-final languages, 
with practical applications to real-time simultaneous interpretation from verb-final 
to verb-medial languages. While previous approaches use classical statistical models, 
we introduce an attention-based neural model to incrementally predict final verbs on 
incomplete sentences in Japanese and German SOV sentences. 
To offer flexibility to the model, we further incorporate synonym awareness. 
Our approach both better predicts the final verbs in Japanese and German 
and provides more interpretable explanations of why those verbs are selected."
