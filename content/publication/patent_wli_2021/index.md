# abstract:"Methods for automatically evaluating ASR outputs and providing annotations, including corrections, on the transcriptions—in order to improve recognition—may be based on an analysis of sessions of user voice queries, utilizing time-ordered ASR transcriptions of user voice queries (ie, user utterances). This utterance-based approach may involve extracting both session-level and query-level characteristics from a voice query sessions and identifying patterns of query reformulation in order to detect erroneous transcriptions and automatically determine an appropriate correction. Alternative, or in addition, ASR outputs may be evaluated based on user behavior. The outcomes may be classified as positive or negative. An ASR transcription may be labeled using the description of the outcome. The labeled transcription may be used as training data to train a model to output improved transcriptions of voice queries."
