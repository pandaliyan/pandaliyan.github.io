Hi! I am Wenyan, a Senior NLP Researcher at [Sensetime](https://sensetime.com/en). 

Before this, I worked as a senior Machine Learning Research Engineer at Comcast AI Research Lab.
I completed my MS at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/), 
where I worked with [Prof. Jordan Boyd-Graber](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~jbg/) on Natural Language Processing.
