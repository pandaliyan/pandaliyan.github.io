Hi! I am Wenyan, a PhD student at the [CoAStaL NLP Group](https://coastalcph.github.io/), University of Copenhagen. 
I'm supervised by [Anders SÃ¸gaard](http://anderssoegaard.github.io/).


Before this, I worked as a Senior NLP Researcher at [Sensetime](https://sensetime.com/en) and [Comcast AI Research Lab](https://jobs.comcast.com/ml-ai-team-page) (mentored by [Ferhan Ture](http://ferhanture.com/index.htm)).

I completed my MS at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/), 
where I worked with [Prof. Jordan Boyd-Graber](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~jbg/) on Natural Language Processing.

In my free time, I enjoy [painting](https://www.instagram.com/pandaliyan/), cooking, yoga, and table tennis :)
