Hi! I am Wenyan. My research focuses on building and interpreting multimodal and NLP models. 
I completed my PhD with a focus on multimodal learning at the [CoAStaL NLP Group](https://coastalcph.github.io/), University of Copenhagen, 
where I was supervised by [Anders Søgaard](http://anderssoegaard.github.io/).


I was also a senior NLP Researcher at [Sensetime](https://sensetime.com/en) and [Comcast AI Research Lab](https://jobs.comcast.com/ml-ai-team-page).
Before that, I spent a wonderful time at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/) for my MS, 
where I worked with [Prof. Jordan Boyd-Graber](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~jbg/) on Natural Language Processing.


Feel free to reach out for collaboration on related projects.


In my free time, I enjoy [painting](https://www.instagram.com/pandaliyan/), cooking, yoga, and table tennis :)
